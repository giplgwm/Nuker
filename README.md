# Nuker
  The original idea of this project was to learn the shelve module and how to restore objects from it. As such this bot can backup/remove/restore the following:
  Channels
  Categories
  Emojis
  Logo
  Banner
  Server Name

  # Usage
  set 'token' to your discord bot token, 'payment_link' as your payment link, change settings in config as desired. Default behaviour is to backup server on join, nuke, and send payment link to every spam text channel created. Turn this behaviour off with b_extort.
